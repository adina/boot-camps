Introducing Python
==================

Python materials
----------------

Navigate your way on your awesome working machines (no setup today yay!) to the 2-Python-Challenge directory and type in `ipython notebook`.
 
Start a new notebook and we'll go through the demo placed at this link:


Note do these all within one cell in the notebook. Bonus points if you can figure out why.

Exercise 1:

Make a dictionary of the data in the grannies.txt file.

Exercise 2:

For each key in the grade dictionary, print out the corresponding values in the grannies dictionary.

Exercise 3:

Edit the grades dictionary to include the values of the grannies dictionary.

Exercise 4:

I'm going to show you some code, work with your partner to figure out what will print based on that code.

Exercise 5:

Split and assign variables to the new grannies file containing both grades and deaths.

Hint:  Dont do this on the giant file.

Exercise 6:

Look at the dict.get method for dictionaries.

I'm going to show you some code, work with your partner to figure out what is going on in this code.

Bonus:  Try to automate this code from start to finish.
